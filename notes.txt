SNS
Need server running on localhost.  This is the local 'SNS topic' host.

An app can publish to sns by sending to localhost:port/snsTopicName-stage (that endpoint will accept the message in the same format as AWS does, then rebroadcast to all subscribers)

Other local apps get subscribe to updates?
    -need to create an interface to allow subscribing?

reinstall angular cli, eslint, stream-adventure

NEXT
1) continue with publish route and function.  have it send a test message to fake subscribers (match real subscriber structure)
    -start with http only for now
