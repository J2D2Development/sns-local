SNS
Need server running on localhost.  This is the local 'SNS topic' host.

An app can publish to sns by sending to localhost:port/snsTopicName-stage (that endpoint will accept the message in the same format as AWS does, then rebroadcast to all subscribers)

Other local apps get subscribe to updates?
