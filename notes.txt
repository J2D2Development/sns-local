SNS
Need server running on localhost.  This is the local 'SNS topic' host.

An app can publish to sns by sending to localhost:port/snsTopicName-stage (that endpoint will accept the message in the same format as AWS does, then rebroadcast to all subscribers)

Other local apps get subscribe to updates?
    -need to create an interface to allow subscribing?

reinstall angular cli, eslint, stream-adventure

NEXT
1) TS working with express returning json.
2) create simple server so i can test hitting my endpoints on 4455- hit a 'subscribe' should add info to subscribers.
3) create typed subscribers.ts and so on- use aws docs as guide for setup.
